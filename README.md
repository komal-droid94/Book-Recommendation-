The system recommends books to users based on two approaches: Content based filtering, Rating based filtering
# Algorithm
Bubble sort with time complexity O(n^2), sortByScore(), bubbleSortByRating(), Linear Search algorithm which goes through database to check for genre filterByGenre()
# Classes

This system mainly uses content-based filtering to match the books with the preferences of a user by scoring books based on tag matching and author preferences. Implementation of Bubble Sort algorithm to rank books by rating within the genres, Linear search algorithm to search through entire database.
